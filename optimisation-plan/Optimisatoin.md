# Phase 1: React.memo() Implementation

- ~~ EditorList - Memoize expensive post list rendering with post icons and filtering ~~
- ~~ EditorMain - Prevent re-renders when metaData hasn't changed ~~
- ~~ EditorSettings - Memoize expensive settings panels ~~
- ~~ AttributesManager - Memoize complex attribute rendering logic ~~
- ~~ ScssPartialsManager - Memoize SCSS partials list processing ~~
- UI Components - Memo frequently re-rendered components (Button, Input, Select, etc.)

Phase 2: Code Splitting Enhancement

- Do not do it -Monaco Editor - Lazy load the heavy Monaco editor (currently ~500KB+)
- ~~ Heavy Modals - Lazy load AddPostModal and other modals ~~
- Settings Panels - Dynamic import for InnerBlocksSettings and complex editor panels
- Route-based Splitting - Split editor components by functionality (blocks/symbols/partials)

Phase 3: API Call Optimization

- ~~ Request Deduplication - Centralize API calls in App.js to prevent redundant requests ~~
- Data Sharing - Pass data down via props instead of independent API calls in child components
- Caching Layer - Implement request caching for frequently accessed data (posts, blocks, partials)
- Batch Operations - Combine multiple API calls into single batch requests where possible

Expected Impact

- Bundle Size: 40-60% reduction through code splitting
- Runtime Performance: 50%+ fewer re-renders through memoization
- Network Efficiency: 60%+ reduction in redundant API calls

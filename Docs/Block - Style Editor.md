# Block Editor Style - Fine-Tune Editor Experience

## What is Editor Style?

Editor Style is where you define styles that **only** apply in the Gutenberg editor. These styles **override** the regular Style section and do not affect the frontend.

## When to Use It

Use Editor Style to fine-tune the editing experience when frontend styles interfere with content editing:

**Fix Visibility Issues:**
- Remove or adjust animations that make it hard to select content
- Fix overlapping elements that block clicking or typing
- Adjust opacity or z-index for better editor interaction

**Improve Editing Clarity:**
- Disable hover effects that interfere with editing
- Adjust spacing to make click areas more accessible
- Simplify complex layouts for easier content management

## How It Works

Editor styles **override** regular styles in the Gutenberg editor only:

- **Style** → Applies to editor and frontend
- **Editor Style** → Applies only in editor, overrides Style

This lets you keep your frontend design intact while making editing smooth and easy.

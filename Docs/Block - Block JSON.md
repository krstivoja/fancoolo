# Block JSON - Automatic Block Configuration

## What is block.json?

The `block.json` file is the technical configuration file that WordPress uses to register and understand your block. It contains all the metadata and settings that define how your block works in Gutenberg.

## You Don't Edit It Directly

Unlike other sections (Content, Style, View), there is **no tab for editing block.json**. This file is completely **autogenerated** by FanCoolo based on the settings you configure throughout the block editor.

## What Gets Generated

FanCoolo automatically creates your block.json file from the settings you provide:

**Block Information:**
- **Title** - The display name of your block
- **Description** - What your block does
- **Icon** - The icon shown in the block inserter
- **Category** - Which category your block appears in

**Block Attributes:**
- All fields you create in the **Attributes Manager** are automatically added to block.json
- Field types, default values, and settings are all generated for you

**File References:**
- Paths to your Content (render.php)
- Paths to your Style and Editor Style CSS files
- Path to your View JavaScript (viewScript or viewScriptModule)

**Block Settings:**
- Support features you enable (alignment, spacing, etc.)
- Inner blocks configuration
- Any other block-specific settings

## How It Works

When you save your block, FanCoolo:

1. Takes all your settings from the editor interface
2. Collects attributes from the Attributes Manager
3. References all the files you've created (content, styles, view)
4. Generates a properly formatted block.json file
5. Saves it alongside your block files

This ensures your block.json is always:
- Correctly formatted
- In sync with your block settings
- Following WordPress standards
- Including all necessary configuration

## Why Autogeneration?

**Eliminates Errors:**
- No manual JSON syntax mistakes
- No typos in property names
- No missing required fields

**Always in Sync:**
- When you add an attribute, it's automatically in block.json
- When you change settings, block.json updates
- No need to manually keep files synchronized

**Follows Best Practices:**
- Uses WordPress block standards
- Correct property naming
- Proper file path references

## What You Control

Instead of editing JSON directly, you control block.json through:

- **Block Settings Panel** - Title, description, icon, category
- **Attributes Manager** - All your custom fields
- **Block Configuration** - Support features, inner blocks, etc.
- **Content/Style/View Sections** - FanCoolo links these files automatically

## Summary

The block.json file is automatically generated by FanCoolo. You don't need to edit it or even think about it - just configure your block through the FanCoolo interface, and a perfect block.json will be created for you.

**Remember:**
- No manual editing of block.json
- Autogenerated from your block settings
- Always in sync with your configuration
- Eliminates JSON syntax errors
- Follows WordPress standards automatically
